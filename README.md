# MidKrRegexTool

A tool for searching Middle Korean texts (encoded in Hanyang PUA) using regular expressions.

## Input

- The tool does not require any corpus to be stored inside the repository. Instead, it always takes one or more external Middle Korean text files (or folders) as input.

## Project Status
This project is in the initial setup and design stage. 
More details and functionality will be added gradually as development proceeds.
