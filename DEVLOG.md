# DEVLOG - MidKrRegexTool

## 2025-12-08

### What I did today
- Created the Github repository `MidKrRegexTool' and cloned it locally.
- Added `README.md`, `DEVLOG.md`, and basic documents under `docs/`.

### Decisions made
- DEVLOG will primarily be maintained in this repository (as a version-controlled file).
- Notion will be used as an external mirrored reference for DEVLOG, updated manually for now (automation can be added later).
- No additional normalization step is required for now, since the input corpus is already consistent in Hanyang PUA.
- The original Middle Korean corpus does not need to be stored inside this repository.
The tool will always take one or more external file paths as input.

### Next tasks
- Draft the overall architecture in `docs/design.md` (e.g., CLI tool structure, module layout).
- Decide on the initial module layout under `src/` (parsing, conversion, search, CLI)

### Goal
- Draft the overall architecture in `docs/design.md`
- Decide on the initial module layout under `src/`

### What I actually did today
- Implemented the first functional version of `parser.py`, which:
    - detects source markers (e.g., `<釋詳3:1a>`),
    - performs whitespace-based tokenization on Middle Korean text encoded in Hanyang PUA,
    - handles both main text and note content (wrapped with [note] ... [/note] markers),
    and assign token-level metadata (`source_id`, `token_index`, `is_note`).
- Checked if `parser.py` works properly using `sample_sekpo_excerpt.txt`, confirming:
    - correct source marker detection and `token_index` reset,
    - correct identification of note vs. non-note segments,
    - and stable handling of Hanyang PUA characters.

### Decisions made
- Notes (`[note] ... [/note]`) are included in the token stream, distinguished only by an `is_note` flag.
- Automated tests (pytest) will be added after the Yale conversion and regex-based search modules are drafted.

### Next tasks
- Begin drafting the Yale conversion layer (`yale.py`) to fill the `yale` field of tokens.
- Draft `search.py`, which will search specific strings based on regex.
- Later: add `pytest`-based tests for parser behavior.

### What I did today
- Improved `quick_check_parser.py` to make parser verification easier:
- Reviewed parser behavior with the sample excerpt and confirmed correct handling of:
    - source marker resets,
    - note vs. main text distinction,
    - token indexing logic.
- Add parser behavior documentation to `design.md`.

### Next tasks
- Begin drafting the Yale conversion module (`yale.py`)
