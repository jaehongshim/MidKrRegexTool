# DEVLOG - MidKrRegexTool

## 2025-12-08

### What I did today
- Created the Github repository `MidKrRegexTool' and cloned it locally.
- Added `README.md`, `DEVLOG.md`, and basic documents under `docs/`.

### Decisions made
- DEVLOG will primarily be maintained in this repository (as a version-controlled file).
- Notion will be used as an external mirrored reference for DEVLOG, updated manually for now (automation can be added later).
- No additional normalization step is required for now, since the input corpus is already consistent in Hanyang PUA.
- The original Middle Korean corpus will **never** be stored inside this repository. The tool will always take an external file path as input.

### Next tasks
- Draft the overall architecture in `docs/design.md` (e.g., CLI tool structure, module layout).
- Decide on the initial module layout under `src/` (parsing, conversion, search, CLI)
